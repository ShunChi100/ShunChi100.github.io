I am a data scientist that looking for exciting opportunities. I am also a researcher with 10+ years research experience in physics , in particular, in superconductivity. My researches span over both experiments and theory. I was retrained as data scientist via the great program at [UBC Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/). 

I also have a [blog](https://shunchi100.wordpress.com) mainly focused on physics and research.
