title: Reduce the cost for home services by electricians, plumbers, etc.
Category: Idea
---

There are many single homes in Vancouver, and the majority of the homes are more than ten years old. Problems of electricity and water happen often. However, the cost of hiring an electrician or plumber is high. I am thinking to find a method to reduce the cost by employing modern technologies. For example, remote online consulting through mobile phones, which could solve some simple problems with small time and money costs. Another example would be install monitoring sensor and transmit the real-time status of things at home, good for predicting (machine learning) as well as revealing problems.
